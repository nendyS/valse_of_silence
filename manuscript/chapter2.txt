# Valse of Silence

Alas my child. Here they are sipping their chosen poison; indulging in each others company. Their eyes meet, the silence between the two is barely noticeable. Looking deep into each other they let a "sigh" of comfort, chuckling in unison as they realized how comforting it is to be next to each other without needing to utter a single word.

As she pulled her eyes from the book she was reading, he approached her from behind, ever so gently as not to disturb her peace. 

Slowly, he leaned towards her and with a deep breath, he felt her essence fill his soul. He was content for that single moment. He enjoyed what he felt, even if it lasted just an instant. He was happy because he knew she was the one the very moment he saw her reading, oblivious to everything around her. 

She turned her head being a bit startled at seeing the stranger leaning so close to her. He stuttered softly "I'm sorry", unsure on what to say for her beauty had overwhelmed his wits. He hesitated but finally managed to say "Please, let me buy you a drink". She replied hesitantly "I'm waiting for someone". 

This lovely lady, this woman who was reading, enjoying verses of her book was still shocked at the handsome stranger, incredulous to what was happening. It is as if what she were reading all of a sudden came to life, a story of romance, a moment of joy; a moment she had hoped to happen to her in real life. She was annoyed at herself because all she could think to say was "I'm waiting for someone else"; and as he had heard those words, he apologized, walking awkwardly away. 

He was shocked at himself for the uncontrollable urge he had felt, but it was not just that, it was for having done what he could not control. For having gone over to the woman of his dreams abruptly, uncontrollably. 

As he was walking away, she too felt something inside of her, something she could not ignore. She too stood up, grabbed him by the shoulder, turned him around, their eyes met and a moment of silence passed as they chuckled in unison when they realized how comforting it was, to be next to each other without needing to utter a single word.
