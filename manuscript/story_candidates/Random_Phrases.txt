In the rare occasion life has mistreated me, it was not but my own perspective which lead me towards a whirlpool of confusions. But as it is, here I am...
Two worms and a bottle of rum, they heard that drinking was a little fun....
Misses the creative link that goes hand in hand with absent mindedness.....
"...the ticking of a mind under the cornerstone of misdirection..."
Corrupted Politicians: Docile Society, Cry Babies.
You must try, before I continue, to understand my present dilemma of unthought ideas, that these may be indeed the ramblings of another misunderstood calamity.
I finally sit myself down to write, but find myself way too sleepy to focus.... if procrastination had a voice, it would be laughing at the irony.
Since before the dawn of science, man has sought to unravel the mysteries of the universe, of God. He has found only one creature as mysterious and beautiful as creation itself; she is known by the name of Woman.
Our individuality is linked to the collective. Our essence to the collective decision. The collective to the world. Science is the attempt to understand that which is not measurable. To believe in science is to follow a collective, a logical mistake. The collective and our individuality repeat circularly until the pattern is broken. In the end, life will continue despite our decisions. Life living for itself.
Life is Life. No matter how it treats you, it´s perfect!
