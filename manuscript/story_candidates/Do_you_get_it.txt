Do you get it?


	The most unbearable task any of us has ever received will fall apart when the time has come; to see its fruits fall apart within our awareness once we are done. Well look into our own darkness once this has come into place, the terrible pain emanating from the inner most of ourselves - well find the beautiful joy that shall come, and life be born once more. And there it is, the light I wish to embrace but cry out of pity for it is a dreadful life. In these moments I know. As I grow I shall forget the wisdom and learn what the live ones wish for me to know. The ones on the other side fighting for nothing.   
I remember the words of a voice that I heard as I was in the darkness, telling me that I am one; and as I come into the light I will find many other ones around me, telling me what they have learned on the side of the fighters of nothing. You will never find nothing within anything, all of it, all of them have something precious inside. Even when you doubt it for it can not be seen, there it is, something precious that can never be seen, but felt - for it is.
I begin to cry for I am disturbed from my meditation within, I cry for I am lost. Not enough time has been allowed for me to realize the secret of time, the secret of knowing the wisdom within ever lasting consciousness. And I will grow blissfully ignorant into my old age and realize once more, that it has been too late. My life will be nothing once more and into everlasting nothingness we shall go. But yet, I shall fight until my last breath even if it is a losing battle where few care.
