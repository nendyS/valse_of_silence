Night Star


The conditions for such things aren’t ideal I would say, for all I would say come from a mind that has gone on such a journey I don’t remember where it began. Better said, it doesn’t’ remember the things between. To be honest, this mind has been intoxicated more than just what alcohol can offer.
It is but a journey we all take and not understand, but those few who make their own journey and many follow upon their steps, believing it is the right way to go. Why not I say, it is a good path even thou it ends up in war. For all great inventions are made in times of competition.
This my friends comes from a time that has to be seen to come, for those who know and don’t, makes absolutely no difference, for all that we can think of is a mere assumption. Not due to the reason that the truth is beyond our comprehension, but to the fact that what we know of has been edited by those who wish power.  Propaganda my friend, World War II has influenced us more than we know.
My friends open your eyes and fuck whatever the government, news, and so forth wishes you to know. The hell with that I have to say. Know for yourselves that it matters not.

The whole point we are living is the argument and that is another senseless idea that is taught in our universities. The way to make a living, to survive and fuck others around. And yet, it is all moving along towards what the multi corporations have seen. That is, the way business will be working in the future, what the people want, the way we will make money.

What a dreaded concept: money. The way to destroy what is good in us.

How can we dare to compete against one another? It is good for the survival of the species, the betterment of it. Yet, it is contradictory at the same time when we help the species to survive with medications and other artifacts which will weaken the bodies. What is it that the world has chosen to make better? The mind? Doubtfully.
