Stick with me and you will find out what it is which makes my head tick; for someone has to do so since I lack the ability for true introspection. 
Run with me in search of that true ideal which will free us from the delusion which is called democracy.
Play with me just one more time to regain what has only been known to a child for a very long time; the wonderful feeling of innocent rejoice, those carefree moments which disappeared once the opinions of others brought forth doubt, the ticking of an insecure mind.
Just let go.
Hurt yourself in love, grow and learn to love again; such are the ways of an insecure mind. One who thought love was a need, one who learned that love is the freedom which we long for; love comes to those who let go of those opinions that brought forth doubt. Love is just that, the pursuit of an attainable goal: freedom of mind.
Such insecurities, lacking such a beautiful rejoice of innocence, the doubts, the ticking of a mind under the cornerstone of misdirection, the fight for power in the technological era, the lack of conviction instilled by misguided opinions – by misdirection, has destroyed the will to power. 
Allow me to learn the way as I walk in error, forgive me for my mistakes; I am nothing but a mere man who has sought after the thought of God: the unforgivable mistake of judging my own, the unjustifiable rationalization of claiming that it is thus, our nature: my weakness, my excuse.
Run along my little friends, run with me; yours is mine and mine is yours: property the excuse of an impoverished mind.
