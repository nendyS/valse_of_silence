A sinful paradise roams in the air, as the lovebirds weep their tortured souls. We sing cries of freedom whilst the stagnating air burdens our stormy path held against our will. We thank our foe's who have taught us to cherish those misguided friends that have gone astray natures path; for love and glory is relentles to the devious plots sewn by crows. 
Run amidst those who jump for joy, fight the martyrs killers. Be as it may be you are the one who has to figure it out, that life is our children's playground.
